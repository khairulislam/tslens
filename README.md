**Which time steps and features did your time-series model actually use?**

tslens is a drop-in, Captum-compatible interpretability toolkit for PyTorch
time-series models. Every method produces a saliency map over the input window so you
can inspect *when* and *where* a model found evidence for its prediction.

Explaining time series models is hard for two reasons that interpretation methods borrowed
from vision and NLP do not handle: subsequent time steps are strongly dependent, and
feature importance varies over time. Existing studies (1) do not consider the temporal
dependencies among the feature vectors in the input window, and (2) consider the time
dimension separately from the feature dimension when calculating importance scores.
**Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)**, the toolkit's native flagship
method, addresses both.

## Why tslens?

- **Model-agnostic:** explain any callable PyTorch model with the expected input shape.
- **Time-aware:** preserve relationships between neighbouring observations, via WinTSR.
- **Joint attribution:** identify important time–feature regions, not just global features.
- **Practical:** support multi-input models, custom baselines, classification, and forecasting.
- **One interface:** compare established interpretation methods from Captum, Time Interpret,
  and this package's own native implementations side by side.

### How it compares

Most general-purpose explainability libraries treat a time series as another input tensor,
while existing time-series packages are documented primarily around classifier or compact
benchmark models. tslens connects a broad attribution API to modern time-series practice:
multi-horizon and multivariate outputs, recent deep forecasting architectures, and
LLM-backed time-series foundation models.

| Capability | **tslens** | [Captum](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/captum) | [Time Interpret](https://github.com/josephenguehard/time_interpret) | [TSInterpret](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/TSInterpret) |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Methods designed for temporal dependencies | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Classification **and** regression/forecasting workflows | ✓ | Generic outputs | Method-dependent | Classification-focused |
| Attribution for each individual forecast horizon | ✓ | Manual target wiring | Manual target wiring | — |
| Joint time–feature maps for multivariate inputs | ✓ | Generic feature maps | Varies by method | Varies by method |
| Documented integration with recent deep time-series models | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Tested with LLM-backed time-series foundation models | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Native and established methods behind one PyTorch API | ✓ | General-purpose methods | Captum + time-series methods | Separate multi-backend API |

Here, “—” means the project does not provide first-class, documented support for the
capability—not that integration is theoretically impossible. Among these libraries,
tslens is the only one with documented, tested integrations spanning TSlib models such
as DLinear, iTransformer, and TimesNet and LLM-backed models such as CALF, OFA/GPT4TS,
and TimeLLM. See the [tested model matrix](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/models/)
and [integration cookbook](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/integration/).

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install tslens
```

Requires Python 3.9+ and PyTorch 1.13+. Works with any PyTorch model mapping
`(batch, seq_len, n_features)` to predictions — no training framework to adopt, no
dataset format to conform to:

```python
import torch
from tslens import WinTSR

inputs = torch.randn(16, 96, 7)             # (batch, seq_len, n_features)
attr = WinTSR(model).attribute(
    inputs,
    baselines=torch.zeros_like(inputs),
    threshold=0.5,
)
attr.shape   # (16, n_output, 96, 7)
```

For local development, install the package with its test and documentation tools:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
pytest
```

Plot `attr` as a heatmap over `(seq_len, n_features)` to read off what the model used.

### Getting started

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **[Quickstart notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/quickstart.ipynb)** | 60 seconds, no dataset download. Plants a known signal, trains a small GRU, checks WinTSR recovers it. |
| **[Real-data case study](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/case_study.ipynb)** | Train DLinear on all seven ETTh1 variables, verify its held-out forecast, and derive temporal and feature-level insights with WinTSR. |
| **[WinIT notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/winit.ipynb)** | Delayed, distributional importance with reference-data counterfactuals, compared directly with WinTSR on the quickstart task. |
| **[GateMask notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/gatemask.ipynb)** | Train a sparse GateMask explanation, measure its runtime, and see how the mask changes with more training. |
| **[TSlib models notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/tslib_models.ipynb)** | Explaining DLinear, iTransformer, TimesNet and friends. No wrapper class needed. |
| **[Pretrained Timer notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_timer.ipynb)** | Zero-shot forecasting with Timer-84M, then time-step attribution through a small generation adapter. |
| **[Pretrained MOMENT notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_moment.ipynb)** | Zero-shot forecasting with MOMENT-1-small, then attribution through its channel-first interface. |
| **[Pretrained TTM notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_ttm.ipynb)** | Fast zero-shot TTM forecasting, native-shape attribution, and a concrete WinTSR threshold comparison. |
| **[Pretrained GPT4TS notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_gpt4ts.ipynb)** | Adapt a frozen GPT-2 backbone to ETTh2 with a quick supervised fit, then explain its forecast. |
| **[Classification notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/classification.ipynb)** | `n_output` becomes the class count; a padding mask goes through as context, not as an attributed input. |
| **[Baselines notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/baselines.ipynb)** | Why the baseline matters, `get_baseline`'s four modes compared by attribution quality, and how to use a custom one. |
| **[Custom outputs notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/custom_outputs.ipynb)** | Wrapping models that return a dict or tuple (TimeLLM-style) with a one-line lambda. |
| **[Integration cookbook](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/integration/)** | Copy-paste recipes: dict/tuple outputs, classification, baselines, single horizons, speed, troubleshooting. |
| **[Interpretation methods](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/methods/)** | What WinTSR, TSR, WinIT and GateMask each do differently, and when to reach for which one. |
| **[API reference](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/reference/wintsr/)** | Every argument, generated from the docstrings, including `legacy_normalize=True` to reproduce the published numbers. |

Already have a TSlib model? It takes four tensors, so split them into what you want
attributed and what is just context:

```python
attr_enc, attr_mark = WinTSR(model).attribute(
    inputs=(x_enc, x_mark_enc),
    baselines=(torch.zeros_like(x_enc), torch.zeros_like(x_mark_enc)),
    additional_forward_args=(x_dec, x_mark_dec),
)
```

## Interpretation methods

tslens gives you a broad set of interpretation methods through one interface, and works
with any PyTorch time series model. WinTSR, TSR, WinIT, and GateMask are implemented
natively here; the rest call [Captum](https://captum.ai/docs/introduction) and
[tint](https://josephenguehard.github.io/time_interpret/build/html/index.html) directly.
See [Interpretation methods](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/methods/) for what
each one does differently and when to use it.

## Supported models

tslens attributes any callable that maps `(batch, seq_len, n_features)` — or a tuple of
tensors — to predictions, so nothing here is hard-coded to a specific architecture. The
list below is what this package and its [research harness](https://github.com/khairulislam/WinTSR-research)

| [src/tslens/](/src/tslens/) | The installable library. `WinTSR` plus the paper's baseline methods (`TSR`, `WinIT`, `GateMask`). |
| [notebooks/](/notebooks/) | Runnable quickstart and TSlib walkthrough. |
| [tests/](/tests/) | Test suite, including a numerical-equivalence check against the pre-refactor implementation. |
| [docs/](/docs/) | Source for the [docs site](https://khairulislam.github.io/tslens/): tutorials, method explainer, API reference, and the PyPI-page library reference. |

This repo is the library only. The training/interpretation harness that produced the
paper's results — model zoo, experiment scripts, saved results — lives in
[WinTSR-research](https://github.com/khairulislam/WinTSR-research) and depends on this
package the same way any user would (`pip install tslens`).

## Reproducing the paper

Training the models, running the full benchmark, and the paper's saved results live in
[WinTSR-research](https://github.com/khairulislam/WinTSR-research), which installs this
package as a regular dependency. That repo also has the model zoo — DLinear,
iTransformer, TimesNet, CALF, TimeLLM and 25 others from
[TSlib](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) — dataset download instructions,
and Docker/Singularity definitions.
