# Supported models

WinTSR is architecture-agnostic. It attributes **any callable** that maps
`(batch, seq_len, n_features)` — or a tuple
of tensors — to predictions. There is no model registry and nothing to subclass: if the
forward pass is a differentiable-or-not PyTorch computation, it can be explained.

That said, real forecasting/classification models rarely take a single clean tensor.
The tables below are the models this package (and its baselines) have actually been
run against, and exactly how to wire each calling convention into `.attribute(...)`.

!!! info "Not listed?"

    The tables record tested integrations, not a compatibility limit. If your callable
    accepts tensors and returns predictions, start with the
    [integration cookbook](integration.md#your-own-model).

## Single-input models

Pass the series straight through — nothing to split.

```

## Dual-input (TSlib) models

These [TSlib](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) models consume every
forward argument themselves (`x_enc, x_mark_enc, x_dec, x_mark_dec`), so the calendar
features get attributed alongside the series. `tslens.attr.tsr.DUAL_INPUT_USERS` is the
canonical list — pass `dual_input_users=[...]` to `TSR` if you're explaining a model not
on it.

attr_enc, attr_mark = WinTSR(model).attribute(
    inputs=(x_enc, x_mark_enc),

See the [integration cookbook](integration.md) for the full walkthrough, or the
[TSlib models notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/tslib_models.ipynb)
to run it.

## Pretrained foundation models

### Timer

[Timer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368) is a generative pretrained Transformer for
zero-shot time-series forecasting. The
[Pretrained Timer notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_timer.ipynb)
loads the public 84M-parameter checkpoint, forecasts ETTh2, and adapts its
`generate()` interface for perturbation-based WinTSR attribution.

### MOMENT

[MOMENT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03885) is an open foundation-model family for
forecasting and other time-series tasks. The
[Pretrained MOMENT notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_moment.ipynb)
loads MOMENT-1-small, forecasts ETTh2, and bridges its channel-first 512-step input
to WinTSR's time-first attribution interface.

### Tiny Time Mixers (TTM)

[TTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03955) is IBM's compact pretrained model family for
zero- and few-shot forecasting. The
[Pretrained TTM notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_ttm.ipynb)
loads the Granite TTM-R2 512/96 checkpoint, attributes its native time-first input, and
visualizes how WinTSR's relevance threshold changes the result.

### GPT4TS / One Fits All

[GPT4TS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11939) adapts a mostly frozen pretrained GPT-2
backbone to time-series tasks through trainable input and output layers. The
[Pretrained GPT4TS notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/khairulislam/tslens/blob/main/notebooks/pretrained_gpt4ts.ipynb)
fits those forecasting layers on ETTh2, verifies a held-out forecast, and explains the
result through GPT4TS's single-input convention.

## Model zoo and training harness

Trained checkpoints, dataset loaders, and experiment scripts for all of the above live
in [WinTSR-research](https://github.com/khairulislam/WinTSR-research) — the paper's
training/interpretation harness, which depends on this package the same way any user
would (`pip install tslens`). This repository ships the attribution methods only; it
does not vendor model code.
