# tslens

### A PyTorch framework for interpreting time-series deep learning models

tslens is a Captum-compatible interpretability toolkit for PyTorch time-series
models. It tells you which time steps and features drove a prediction. The
package bundles WinTSR — a local interpretation method that accounts for
dependencies between neighbouring time steps and scores time and feature
importance jointly — alongside other established interpretation methods behind
one consistent interface.

## What you get

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-chart-timeline-variant-shimmer:{ .lg .middle } **Time-aware explanations**

    Preserve relationships between neighbouring observations instead of treating
    every input position independently.

-   :material-table-eye:{ .lg .middle } **Joint time–feature attribution**

    Locate the specific regions of an input window that mattered for a prediction.

-   :material-connection:{ .lg .middle } **Flexible model integration**

    Explain single- or multi-input PyTorch callables without adopting a training
    framework or dataset format.

-   :material-compare:{ .lg .middle } **A consistent comparison surface**

    Use WinTSR alongside established interpretation methods from Captum and Time
    Interpret.

## Why tslens instead of another interpretability library?

General-purpose explainability libraries treat a time series as another input tensor,
while existing time-series packages are documented primarily around classifier or compact
benchmark models. tslens connects a broad attribution API to modern time-series practice:
multi-horizon and multivariate outputs, recent deep forecasting architectures, and
LLM-backed time-series foundation models.

!!! note "A scoped comparison"

    “—” means the project does not provide first-class, documented support for the
    capability—not that integration is theoretically impossible. Among these libraries,
    tslens is the only one with documented, tested integrations spanning TSlib models such
    as DLinear, iTransformer, and TimesNet and LLM-backed models such as CALF, OFA/GPT4TS,
    and TimeLLM. See [tested models](models.md) and the
    [integration cookbook](integration.md).

## Interpretation methods

tslens covers perturbation, gradient, learned-mask, and surrogate approaches
through the same PyTorch workflow, so you can pick a method based on your
model, explanation goal, and available compute.

## Quickstart

Install tslens from PyPI. Python 3.9+ and PyTorch 1.13+ are required.

```bash
pip install tslens
```

Pass a model and a tensor shaped `(batch, seq_len, n_features)`:

```python
import torch
from tslens import WinTSR

inputs = torch.randn(16, 96, 7)
baselines = torch.zeros_like(inputs)

attr = WinTSR(model).attribute(
    inputs,
    baselines=baselines,
    threshold=0.5,
)

attr.shape  # (16, n_output, 96, 7)
```

The result contains one `(seq_len, n_features)` saliency map for each model output.
Plot a map as a heatmap to inspect where the model found evidence.

!!! tip "Start with a faithful baseline"

    Zeros are appropriate for standardized inputs. If zero has a special meaning in
    your data, use [`get_baseline`](reference/functional.md) to generate a mean,
    normal, or random baseline.

## Key options

| Argument | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `threshold` | Quantile of time relevance skipped during stage two. Higher values are faster and produce sparser maps; `0.0` keeps every step. |
| `sliding_window_shapes` | Attribution window over `(time, features)`. Increase the first value to attribute multi-step regions. |
| `baselines` | Values substituted for occluded regions. Defaults to zero. |
| `unflatten` | When `True` (default), returns `(batch, n_output, seq_len, n_features)`. |
| `legacy_normalize` | Constructor option that reproduces the normalization used for the published results. |

See the [WinTSR API reference](reference/wintsr.md) for every option.

## Multi-input models

Pass attributed tensors as a tuple and supply unchanged context through
`additional_forward_args`. For a TSlib model:

```python
attr_enc, attr_mark = WinTSR(model).attribute(
    inputs=(x_enc, x_mark_enc),
    baselines=(torch.zeros_like(x_enc), torch.zeros_like(x_mark_enc)),
    additional_forward_args=(x_dec, x_mark_dec),
)
```

The [integration cookbook](integration.md) covers TSlib, classification, custom model
outputs, single forecast horizons, baseline selection, and performance tuning.
